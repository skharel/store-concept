Built using tutorial for redux from Tyler Mcginnis course. Pretty awesome course if you want to learn Redux:

1. Just to see basics of store (JS) code only run:

   run `node app.js`

2. To see the store from step 1 tied to UI, go to UI and open index.html in browser (no webserver is needed). The index.html only depends on index.js and nothing else.

3) Step 3 takes the code directory from step 2, deletes our store implementation and uses the Redux API.
